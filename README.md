Epileptic Seizure Detection with Neural Networks
This project aims to develop a neural network model to classify epileptic seizure data based on EEG signals. The model uses a synthetic dataset to simulate EEG features, but real EEG datasets (like the UCI Epileptic Seizure dataset) can be used for actual applications. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras and includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization steps.

# Features
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing: Load and preprocess data using standard scaling and splitting.
2. Model Architecture: Neural network model built with Keras, designed for binary classification of seizure vs. no seizure.
3. Training and Evaluation: Model training with accuracy metrics and confusion matrix visualization.

# Dataset
The project uses a synthetic dataset with 178 EEG features per sample.
For real-world applications, replace the synthetic data with a real EEG dataset, such as the UCI Epileptic Seizure Recognition dataset.


# Requirements
Python 3.x
Packages: numpy, tensorflow, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

# Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Run the script to train and evaluate the neural network model.
3. Replace Dataset: For real-world applications, replace the synthetic dataset with real EEG data in the script.

# Script Workflow

1. Data Loading: Loads data from a CSV file and separates features (X) and labels (y).
2. Data Preprocessing: Standardizes features using StandardScaler and splits data into training and test sets.
3. Model Architecture:
A neural network with three dense layers and dropout layers for regularization.
Output layer uses a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
4. Model Training: Trains the model on the training set with validation data to monitor accuracy and loss over 20 epochs.
5. Evaluation:
Calculates accuracy on test data.
Visualizes accuracy and loss over epochs, and displays a confusion matrix.
6. Visualization: Plots training and validation metrics, and displays the confusion matrix and a summary table of model performance.

# Visualization Examples

1. Training & Validation Accuracy: Plots the accuracy of the model over training epochs.
2. Loss Visualization: Shows training and validation loss over time.
3. Confusion Matrix: Displays a matrix of predictions vs. actual values for seizure and non-seizure classifications.
